                        This website is the sandbox of experiements I have been wanting to create
                        for a while now. I plan to 'publish' / make public some of my work I have done,
                        and force myself to create more. Lets dive into who I am, the need for 'THIS' website,
                        and the types of content I want here.

                        I graduted highschool with an associates and went with the good ol' university route (GIG 'EM).
                        Orginaly, I went to university for biomedical sciences with the idea in my head
                        that one day I wanted to become a doctor. 
                        Well, after I finished Organic Chemistry 2 and some health sciences classes,
                        I decided I wasn't as interested in medicine as I thought.
                    </p>
                    <p className="comments">
                        I just didn't like all the memorization. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I tried looking into hospital admin and other specialities, but I couldn't find a fit.
                        It felt like I had wasted the past 3 years (this includes my time in highschool getting my associates),
                        but luckily my partner suggested that I look into studying computers. So I decided I wanted to give a try at
                        Computer Science. Unfortunately, I tried to join in probably the largest surge of computer science undergradutates
                        in our history which was right after Covid-19 pandemic. I was rejected and I had to reapply before I was accepted in.
                        Once getting over this hurdle, it felt like things were starting to click into place.

                        
                        Now I'm busy pondering what I should do in my free time,
                        which of course is to learn more.
                        So here I am trying to make this website / idea come to fruition. I constantly see
                        people on LinkedIn posting their portfolios as well, 
                        so I guess this will be my sh*tty portfolio too now. 

                        I have 2 dogs and 3 chickens at the time of writing this.

                        I'm currently really inspired by early 2000's websites and all the aura they had with them.
                        Which is kind of what I am trying to base my / this website around.
                        Also, I do not consider myself a front-end engineer whatsoever, s
