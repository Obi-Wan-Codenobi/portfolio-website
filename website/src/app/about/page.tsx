                        for a while now. I plan to 'publish' / 'make public' some of my work I have done,
                        and force myself to create more. Lets dive into who I am, the need for this website,
                        and the type of content I want here.

                        I graduted highschool with an associates and went with the good ol' university route (GIG 'EM).
                        Orginaly, I went to university for pre-med with the idea in my head
                        that one day I wanted to become a doctor.
                        Well, after I finished Organic Chemistry 2 and some health sciences classes,
                        I decided I was not as interested in medicine as I thought.

                        I just didn't like all the memorization. Felt like I was not learning a skill.

                        {`
                        I tried looking into hospital admin and other specialities,
                        but I couldn't find a fit. It felt like I had wasted the past 3 years
                        (this includes my time getting my associates),
                        but luckily my partner suggested that I look into computers.
                        I really enjoyed building PC's growing up and always
                        wanted to learn to code.
                        So I decided I wanted to give a try at Computer science,
                        I also liked how it felt like I was going to walk away
                        from college with a skill. Unfortunately, I tried to join in probably
                        the largest surge of computer science undergradutates
                        in our history which was right after Covid-19 pandemic.
                        I was rejected and I had to reapply before I was accepted in.
                        Once getting over this hurdle, it felt like things were starting to click into place.

                        Now after joining a sweaty major with people who have
                        been coding since birth, I had try and catch up if I was
                        going to get internships. I grinded projects and applications
                        while doing classes. Unfortunately, internships were far
                        and few between, plus they expected you to have some
                        type of experience already.

                        {`
                        I was able to pick up an internship with a local union that Summer
                        to build them a dashboard. I did this for free because I was
                        focused on building experience. This later turned into a nice
                        side hustle job in college. When I returned back to school that
                        following Fall, I kept grinding and landed 2 internship interviews.
                        Just shows how important exeperince is. I bombed the first interview.
                        I practiced (not as much as I should have) for the second interview,
                        and thought I fumbled this one too. I ended up getting a call back,

                        Now I'm busy pondering what I should do in my free time,
                        which of course is to learn more.
                        So here I am trying to make this website / idea come to fruition.
                        I constantly see people on LinkedIn posting their portfolios as well,
                        so I guess this will be my sh*tty portfolio too now.

                        I have 2 dogs and 3 chickens at the time of writing this.

                        I'm currently really inspired by early 2000's websites and all the aura they had with them.
                        Which is kind of what I am trying to base my / this website around.
                        Also, I do not consider myself a front-end engineer whatsoever, s
