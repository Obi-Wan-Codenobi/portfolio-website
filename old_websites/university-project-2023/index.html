        <p class="box">
            This website is currently part of a school project that I am doing for CSCE 331.
            I plan to keep this website up to date and later add my personal web API that is built out in go to service
            my personal blogposts.

                My name is Jaxon, and I am currently studying the field of computer science at Texas A&M University.
                I will be graduating in the Fall of 2024 and I am currently looking for internships for the summer of
                2024.
                I love to snowboard and I am a big fan of backcountry free ride snowboarding.
                In my free time when I am not coding, I am taking care of my plants and playing with my cat.

        <h2> My personal journey in Computer Science </h2>
        <p class="box">
            I originally went to college with the desire to pursue medicine and become a doctor.
            The first semester I attended many seminars of other doctorsâ€™ journey through medicine and decided that was
            not for me.
            This was mainly because I did not want to give up all of my twenties for a career and take on an extreme
            amount of debt.
            The next semester, after I had finished Organic Chemistry II, I decided I did not enjoy the content I was
            learning and needed to switch.
        </p>

        <p class="box">
            I tried switching majors into computer science or computing.
            I was rejected and applied again the following semester to only be rejected again.
            That semester I took a computer science class on a leap in hopes that it would get me in.
            I also started personal projects and competed in hackathons/datathons.
            It ended up paying off and I was accepted into computing.
            This was life changing for me and completely took away the anxiety I had been feeling all semester.
        </p>

        <p class="box">
            I am super thankful to be studying something I enjoy while attending my favorite university.
            I feel that this kind of testifies to the point, that if you love it, keep pursing it!
